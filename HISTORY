of mainline).

********************************************************************************

1. The Beginnings of the Chaos Empire
-------------------------------------

At some unknown point in the times after the Fall of the third sun, a new leader
rises among the coastal human settlements at Kalari, and teaches an unseen form
of magic to a handful of adepts who help him take over the local inhabitants'
mind and will with power coming rom Zocthanol Isle. His closest adepts are from
that point known as the Iron Triad, and they start collecting the energy
required to open a new connection to the demonic homeworld and free Uria, the
mother of demons.

A signal coming from Zocthanol is sent to the skies in the form of an eerie
pulsating green glow for a few days.

From this point on, the timeline is structured around the point on which the
main gateway to Inferno was opened in the Valley of Weldyn, and divided in two

  - Human followers of the Chaos cult begin to succumb to uncertainity and

The Chaos Empire begins after most of the Great Continent has been overrun by
the combined forces of shaxthal creatures, demons and Chaos soldiers.

The Far North at this point has become a somewhat stable and thriving ensemble
of human and orcish countries. Occassional conflicts ensue between the human
kingdoms, but by the middle of this period, they join the Aragwaith country and
later establish a long-lasting alliance with the orcish countries and minor
tribes.

The dwarvish population is concentrated on the depths of the Heart Mountains,
and more clans join the recently united Kingdom of New Knalga.

The desert elves at the Zocthanol Isle stay unaware of the events in the main
continent.

* 144 DE
  - Uria gives Shadow Master the order to find Elynia, capture and convert her

    and use it to completely and permanently merge Inferno and Irdya.

    Elyssa's body, which is shortly rebuilt using better technology than the

  - The orcish and human countries in the Far North officially declare war
    against the Chaos Empire.

  - Elynia, Galas, Mal Keshar and a group of dwarves launch a suicidal attack on
    the Heart of the Empire. Elyssa faces Galas and his band directly this time,
    but as she is about to defeat them, Elynia and Mal Keshar summon the Union
    of the Powers of Light and Darkness by taking advantage of a flaw, unknown
    to them, that allows Mal Keshar to acquire them from Inferno.

  - Mal Keshar and Elynia manage to defeat Elyssa. However, they spare her life
    and let her flee from the Heart in exchange for information about Inferno
    and Shadow Master's location.

    and converted by Uria, who used a gap in Irdya's deepest reaches to
    physically contact Argan.

  - Elynia kills Shadow Master with the Power of the Union, which destroys
    itself as a consequence. The Heart's structure is weakened by the closure
    of its connection with Inferno, and it turns into a great chasm from which
    Galas' band barely escapes.

  - The Chaos Empire's frontier defenses are severely weakened by the northern
    armies' relentless attacks.

    Chaos cultists in the northern frontiers.

    with one of his bodyguards under strange circumstances, after speaking
    against the idea of acquiring weapons and technology from the Chaos Empire.

    lord's oppositors are responsible of the murder, and begin a civil war to
    drive them out of the northern forests.

    command departs for the northwestern lands.

    Keshar and the orcs' help, travel to Zocthanol isle.

  - In Zocthanol's isle, Elynia learns that Yechnagoth's heart was not
    destroyed by Kalehssar. It was later recovered by the Triad and stored in
    the shaxthal hive located in Wesmere's ruined plains.

 * 149 DE
  - During their voyage back to the main continent, Galas' band is captured by
    the Iron Triad's soldiers at Kalari Peninsula. They are imprisoned and
    tortured, but they manage to escape from the Triad's fortress after Galas
    sacrifices himself to distract Elyssa and the Triad. The secret of the
    staff of Elynia-Niryone is revealed to Mal Keshar and Kri'tan.

    while escaping from Kalari Peninsula.

    territory along with the dark sorceress Zynavu-Malal, one of Mal Keshar's
    disciples.

* 150 DE
  - Elynia's band destroys a gigantic shaxthal creature assumed to contain
    Yechnagoth's heart. Taking advantage of the hive's design, Mal Keshar
    orders Elynia to leave the place while he uses dwarven technology to
    destroy it completely so the Chaos Empire cannot continue using it to
    create new shaxthal creatures. It is unknown to them that three other hives
    exist, and that five more are being built.

  - While Mal Keshar successfully destroys the dark hive, Elynia is caught by
    the explosion. Although the dwarves do not find her or Mal Keshar's
    remains, they do find her staff's top gem, the Ruby of Fire.

  - Using tissue samples taken from Elynia during the fight at Kalari Peninsula,
    Mal Kendria and Mal Hekuba of the Iron Triad build an organic disguise for
    Ivyel to make her look and sound like the sylvan fairy. Yechnagoth's heart
    is embedded into the shaxthal creature's body.
