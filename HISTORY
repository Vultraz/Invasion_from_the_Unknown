- Large civilizations are disbanded by the natural disaster.
- Dantair of Wesnoth survived from the cataclysm, but is shortly killed by
  citizens who become prey of panic.

    Zhangor.

    capital. Eventually, Elynia and Argan success and lead an invasion to the
    capital and confront Zhangor himself, who reveals his true appearance and
    nature as a Demon Lord.

  - Elynia and Argan use the power of the Union of Light and Darkness for the
    first time.

  - Zhangor is vanquished, and his body banished from Irdya. Wesmere Forest is
    almost completely destroyed in the process, causing high casualties on both

    the lore of their ancestors starts to be forgotten. Quetor'el dies during
    a fight that almost kills the entire population of the desert elves. The few
    survivors gain access to tables and scrolls written by the fallen druids;
    however, most of them are either damaged or ciphered, and as a result, most
    of the ancient knowledge they relearn is inaccurate or plain wrong.

  - The surviving desert elves establish a new fortress upon an oasis around
    which they build the Quenoth village.


5. The Beginnings of the Chaos Empire
-------------------------------------

At some unknown point in the times after the Fall of the third sun, a new leader
rises among the coastal human settlements at Kalari, and teaches an unseen form
of magic to a handful of adepts who help him take over the local inhabitants'
mind and will with power coming rom Zocthanol Isle. His closest adepts are from
that point known as the Iron Triad, and they start collecting the energy
required to open a new connection to the demonic homeworld and free Uria, the
mother of demons.

A signal coming from Zocthanol is sent to the skies in the form of an eerie
pulsating green glow for a few days.

From this point on, the timeline is structured around the point on which the
main gateway to Inferno was opened in the Valley of Weldyn, and divided in two
periods: Before the Empire (BE) and After the Empire (AE).

    her control. It is presumed that this is Yechnagoth.

  - Elyssa attempts to escape only to be recaptured and imprisoned.

  - Human followers of the Chaos cult begin to succumb to uncertainity and
    despair. The Iron Triad manages to summon a new demon lord, Nar-hamoth, to
    keep the rebels under control and strengthen the fanatism and attract more
    adepts.

the combined forces of shaxthal creatures, demons and Chaos soldiers.

* 124 AE
  - Uria gives Shadow Master the order to find Elynia, capture and convert her
    to her side. Although Uria does not reveal the true reason to Shadow Master
    and the Iron Triad, she is actually searching to acquire the Ruby of Fire
    and use it to completely and permanently merge Inferno and Irdya.

  - The Valley of Elynia, the last elven fortress left in the Great Continent,
    is taken over by the forces of Chaos. A substantial part of the elves
    escapes in time and heads underground.

* 125 AE
  - Elyssa's expedition to the Heart Mountains stumbles upon a band of elves
    led by Galas, an elvish fighter; Anlind√´, a former priest of Zhangor; and
    Mal Keshar.

  - Galas' band allies with the dwarves of New Knalga to defeat Elyssa's
    soldiers. Elyssa retreats and calls for reinforcements.

* 126 AE
  - With the help from a dwarven runemaster by the name of Althurin, the elves
    set Elynia free and fight the vanguard of Elyssa's battalion.

  - Elves and dwarves leave the Heart Mountains due to the overwhelming number
    of enemy soldiers, who finally manage to take over New Knalga.

  - Anlind√´ stays behind to fight Elyssa in a one-to-one duel. Although Anlind√´
    loses the fight, she collapses part of the cave system before dying, thus

    Elyssa's body, which is shortly rebuilt using better technology than the
    first time.

    with flying vehicles.

* 127 AE
  - Elynia, Galas, Mal Keshar and a group of dwarves launch a suicidal attack on
    the Heart of the Empire. Elyssa faces Galas and his band directly this time,
    but as she is about to defeat them, Elynia and Mal Keshar summon the Union
    of the Powers of Light and Darkness by taking advantage of a flaw, unknown
    to them, that allows Mal Keshar to acquire them from Inferno.

  - Mal Keshar and Elynia manage to defeat Elyssa. However, they spare her life
    and let her flee from the Heart in exchange for information about Inferno
    and Shadow Master's location.

  - Shadow Master reveals to Elynia and Mal Keshar that he is Argan, resurrected
    and converted by Uria, who used a gap in Irdya's deepest reaches to
    physically contact Argan.

  - Elynia kills Shadow Master with the Power of the Union, which destroys
    itself as a consequence. The Heart's structure is weakened by the closure
    of its connection with Inferno, and it turns into a great chasm from which
    Galas' band barely escapes.
