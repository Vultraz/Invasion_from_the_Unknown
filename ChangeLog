Invasion from the Unknown - changelog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[p]: placeholder | [t]: testing | [u]: unstable

Version 1.10.0-svn:
- Ported from 1.4 branch to trunk. Cycholka ran wmllint on it for
  making it compatible with Wesnoth 1.5.1 and later.

- Graphics:
    - Added baseframes: Elvish Civilian (bow attack)
    - Gave Elynia a separate standing frame when she's over water, impassable or
      unwalkable terrains - she also uses this frame while flying.
    - Removed now unnecessary generic portraits: Lich, Dark Adept,
      female Dark Adept
    - Updated baseframes: Elynia, Elvish Civilian, Blood Imp
    - Updated portraits: Dryad [p], Elynia [p]

- Language and i18n:
    - Changed unit race text for female Demons from "race+female^Demon"
      to "race+female^Demoness".
    - Changed female unit_type names for the Demon tree to contain be of the
      "Demoness" form rather than "Demon".

- Music and sound effects:
    - Added battle7.ogg, a work-in-progress music piece by Rain that I liked. :)
    - Removed West's "sad.ogg" since its mainline original, "nr-sad.ogg" is
      being moved to a public location reachable by this campaign.

- Scenarios:
    - Sanitized many event unit filters.
    - Some dialogs were improved.
    - 10 (The Source of Light):
        - Made berserk potion have effect only until the end of this scenario.
        - Fixed some awkward grammar
          (http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=305960#p305960)
    - 16 (Arrival of the Battalion):
        - Fixed a bug which made Quogar Ratham always speak a line that Erathan
          is supposed to speak otherwise.
    - 22B (Gauntlet):
        - Added #undefs to avoid conflicting macros screwing up scenario
          23C's ("The Backyard") logic.
        - Drones now use Formula AI rules.

- Terrains:
    - Made Dark Road terrain play better with castle/keep terrain types
      (C*, K*).
    - Renamed many terrain types, rendering some old saved games unusable.
    - Revised most of the terrain graphics layout code to be 1.5.x-compatible.

- Units:
    - Balancing:

          on Reef terrain.

    - Fixed a bug which caused AnlindÃ« to lose her portrait after advancing to
      level 4.

      Runesmith's attack animation.
    - Fixed WEAPON_SPECIAL_DRAINS -> WEAPON_SPECIAL_DRAIN typo on Giant Leech.
