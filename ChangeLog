Invasion from the Unknown - changelog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[P]: placeholder | [T]: testing | [U]: unstable

Version 1.10.0-svn:
- Ported from 1.4 branch to trunk. Cycholka/Mist ran wmllint on it for
  making it compatible with Wesnoth 1.5.1 and later.
- Prevented past-the-end WML array access using new macros,
  VARIABLE_RANDOM_SUBSCRIPT and RANDOM_SUBSCRIPT.
  All WML found with the regular expression /\.\.\$[a-zA-Z0-9_]*\.length/
  was fixed to use this method.
- Removed many unused macros.
    - Ditch IS_ON_MAP in favor of mainline NOT_ON_RECALL_LIST.

- Graphics:
    - Added baseframes: Elvish Civilian (bow attack)
    - Gave Elynia a separate standing frame when she's over water, impassable or
      unwalkable terrains - she also uses this frame while moving.
    - Removed now unnecessary generic portraits: Lich, Dark Adept,
      female Dark Adept
    - Updated baseframes: Elynia, Elvish Civilian, Blood Imp, Shaxthal Drone,
                          Shaxthal Assault Drone, Shaxthal Wyrm
    - Updated portraits: Dryad [P], Elynia [P]

- Language and i18n:
    - Changed unit race text for female Demons from "race+female^Demon"
      to "race+female^Demoness".
    - Changed female unit_type names for the Demon tree to contain be of the
      "Demoness" form rather than "Demon".

- Music and sound effects:
    - Added battle7.ogg, a work-in-progress music piece by Rain that I liked. :)
    - Removed West's "sad.ogg" since its mainline original, "nr-sad.ogg" is
      being moved to a public location reachable by this campaign.

- Scenarios:
    - Changed all instances of "alright" to more formal expressions as
      suggested by Espreon.
    - Sanitized many event unit filters.
    - Some dialogs were improved.
    - 9 (The Library):
        - Galas movement costs in cave terrains don't get reduced on hardest
          difficulty.
    - 10 (The Source of Light):
        - Made berserk potion have effect only until the end of this scenario.
        - Fixed some awkward grammar
          (http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=305960#p305960)
    - 16 (Arrival of the Battalion):
        - Fixed a bug which made Quogar Ratham always speak a line that Erathan
          is supposed to speak otherwise.
    - 22B (Gauntlet):
        - Did significant clean-ups, removing most variables and all macros
          that were used before.
          <self_propaganda>
            As a result of these changes being made by Shadow Master, these
            will require a recent revision of Wesnoth 1.5.x trunk, or 1.5.3
            release, due to a small engine bugfix he made in mainline so
            that attacker and defender weapons are passed to 'die' and
            'last breath' events. No other dev could possibly be bothered
            to fix it... ;-)
          </self_propaganda>
        - Drones now use Formula AI rules.
    - 23A (Interim):
        - Clean-ups.
        - Reduced turn limit.
    - 23B (Welcome to the Lair of the Shadow Master):
        - Attacking the boss with the union does not make him
          vulnerable to other kinds of attacks.

        - Changed controller for side of door units from 'ai'
          to 'null'.

          on Reef terrain.
