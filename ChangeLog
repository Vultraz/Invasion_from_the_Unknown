                    INVASION FROM THE UNKNOWN - CHANGELOG
________________________________________________________________________________

     [D]: definitive | [P]: placeholder | [T]: testing | [U]: unstable
________________________________________________________________________________

Version 1.10.0-svn:
- Ported from 1.4 branch to trunk. Cycholka/Mist ran wmllint on it for
  making it compatible with Wesnoth 1.5.1 and later.
- Prevented past-the-end WML array access using new macros,
  VARIABLE_RANDOM_SUBSCRIPT and RANDOM_SUBSCRIPT.
  All WML found with the regular expression /\.\.\$[a-zA-Z0-9_]*\.length/
  was fixed to use this method.
- Removed many unused macros.
    - Ditch IS_ON_MAP in favor of mainline NOT_ON_RECALL_LIST.
- Switched back from ~ preprocessor includes to @, which allows IftU to be
  loaded from a mainline datadir if present. This is completely absurd IMO, but
  users of our SVN trunk have the weird habit of making the checkout in such
  exotic locations...

- Graphics:
    - Added baseframes: Elvish Civilian (bow attack)
    - Added portraits: Elvish Civilian male [P] and female [P]
    - Gave Elynia a separate standing animation when she's over water,
      impassable or unwalkable terrains - she also uses this animation while
      moving.
    - Removed now unnecessary generic portraits: Lich, Dark Adept,
      female Dark Adept
    - Updated baseframes: Elynia, Elvish Civilian, Blood Imp, Shaxthal Drone,
                          Shaxthal Assault Drone, Shaxthal Wyrm
    - Updated portraits: Dryad [P], Elynia [P]

- Language and i18n:
    - Changed unit race text for female Demons from "race+female^Demon"
      to "race+female^Demoness".
    - Changed female unit_type names for the Demon tree to be of the
      "Demoness" form rather than "Demon".

- Music and sound effects:
    - Added battle7.ogg, a work-in-progress music piece by Rain that I liked. :)
    - Removed West's "sad.ogg" since its mainline original, "nr-sad.ogg" is
      being moved to a public location reachable by this campaign.

- Scenarios:
    - Added first-time description for Elynia, Erathan and Althurin.
    - Character first-time descriptions and the option to skip them are enabled
      when starting straight from episode II.
    - Changed all instances of "alright" to more formal expressions as
      suggested by Espreon.
    - Player can choose Galas initial unit type when starting straight from
      episode II.
    - Revised glamour ability WML and enabled HP changes (still quirky due to
      engine bugs on arithmetic with WML variables containing real numbers)
    - Sanitized many event unit filters.
    - Some dialogs were improved (Shadow Master alone, with nobody's help!
                                  mwahahahahahhaaa!!!)
    - 2 (A Real Confrontation):
        - A few dialogue improvements at the start - they also involve changes
          on the free recall mechanics.
        - Other balancing changes.
    - 9 (The Library):
        - Galas movement costs in cave terrains don't get reduced on hardest
          difficulty.
    - 10 (The Source of Light):
        - Made berserk potion have effect only until the end of this scenario.
        - Mal Keshar explains why Elynia hid herself in this cave.
        - Fixed some awkward grammar
          (http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=305960#p305960)
    - 16 (Arrival of the Battalion):
        - Fixed a bug which made Quogar Ratham always speak a line that Erathan
          is supposed to speak otherwise.
    - 22B (Gauntlet):
        - Did significant clean-ups, removing most variables and all macros
          that were used before.
        - Drones now use Formula AI rules.
    - 23A (Interim):
        - Clean-ups.

          turn that "Interim" was finished plus one

          far harder, fixing old bugs, and changing the former balance.

      (C*, K*).

          on Reef terrain.
