INVASION FROM THE UNKNOWN / ARMAGEDDON: CAST OF CHARACTERS
----------------------------------------------------------

This is a definitive profile list for characters in Invasion from the Unknown. Although some of them
might be present in other campaigns, including mainline, the intention here is to demonstrate a certain
degree of evolvement of themselves, which is specially important for this campaign, where the plot
takes a crucial part in its development as a continued history and as a WML product by itself.

1. THE GOOD
-----------

1.1. Galas
----------

He is basically a young boy that grew up admiring this father's deeds in battle for defending the home
valley against intruders, until a fateful day in which a stray missile crushed his craneum, causing him
a brief but painful death. Galas trained hard since then and got himself involved in the defense patrols,
to the point he got a leading rank in one of the parties that was in charge of the southern frontiers.
He also developed a "cold" personality and behavior, becoming a notable leader, and getting revenge on
his father's murderers with time.

Later after the point at which this campaign begins, his hidden nightmares become true with the arrival
of the Chaos hordes. He turns into a doubtful boy yet again, and loses his natural leadership, which is
forced to be kept alive by Anlindë, his adopted mother, who pushes him into the difficult position of
deciding the future of the elven kind.

After meeting Elynia in scenario 10, he somehow finds himself thinking weird things about her; he falls
in love with her.

In scenario 11, Galas finds himself yet again in a difficult and fateful situation; Anlindë, his adopted
mother, decides to sacrifice herself as a distraction for the enemy while elves and dwarves escape the
sieged New Knalga. He would have gone into panic if it wasn't for Elynia's wise words.

After assuming the events, and adapting to the new scheme, Galas recovers his leadership and leads the
party to the Grand Council with the men of Aragwaith in scenario 14. After Erathan, a human ranger,
joins the party, Galas basically enforces his leadership by taking decissions without having to listen
instructions or suggestions as he did when Anlindë was around, and by imposing them over the human's
advice.

In scenario 20, he realizes that he is no longer alone in the world, and that Elynia, Mal Keshar, and
even Erathan, are willing to follow him to the end of the world if necessary to accomplish the mission
that Anlindë enforced on him: save the Elvish race.

In scenario 22-B and C, he takes Argan's place as Elynia's companion and fiancée, basically because
Argan himself asked him to do so before dying to never return. See Argan/Shadow Master's profile in
The Bad (2) section for details.

Physical attributes:
* He is very young, almost a boy, but still a capable and ocassionally fierce and frightening warrior.
* Hair: blonde
* Eyes: blue
* Height: average for his age

Details available from:
* Shadow Master/ShikadiLord


1.2. Elynia
-----------

She enters the group after scenario 10, and has a secondary role in dialogues although her importance
to the mission is the highest.

Nobody knows where or why she came to Wesnoth, but her arrival should have taken place around 750 YW,
when Elves, Dwarves and Orcs allied to defeat a Wesfolk Lich Lord that invaded the Great Continent.
Therefore, she probably witnessed the arrival of the Aragwaithi and the attack of Grekulak's Akladians
later. Refer to campaign "A New Order" for information on that historic period, irrelevant to this
document.

It's very little what is known about her past; she probably was an elvish maiden before that achieved
the status of Elvish Shyde, and got blessed by the Union(1) later; at the end, she is more tightly
bound to her faerie side rather than elven. As a side-effect, her appearance is eternally youthful.

There is a small hint about her obscure origin, during the fight against the Shadow Master. Dialog
fragment follows:

- Elynia: I am being serious. Mal Keshar, let's finish with this once and for all!
- Mal Keshar: As you command, my lady. Let's do it.
- Argan/Shadow Master: I was the one who granted you life in first place, when you were nothing
    but an automaton. I sacrificed everything for you, and this is how you pay!? No... no! If you
    really want to suffer the same fate of others, to be enslaved by my power, then so be it. You
    have chosen it, and the Union cannot save you... not without me!

Although her appearance is youthful, her melancholic face clearly denotes the knowledge she possesses,
and the many trials she must have passed to achieve it. Still, she shall not reveal any of that
knowledge to anyone except the few ones she trusts. Besides that, her whimsical behavior equals
that of most faeries.

Physical attributes:
* Eyes: red - orange
* Hair: very pale red - rose
* Youthful overall appearance, usually melancholic

Details available from:
* Shadow Master/ShikadiLord


1.3. Mal Keshar
---------------

He enters the group after scenario 3, initially serving as some sort of mercenary; he was willing
to help them find Elynia, but never thought that their journey would remind him of his difficult
past. At the start his power was superseded by Anlindë's, but later he would had many oportunities
of slaying the elves, which he didn't use. Soon he would find himself taking care of Galas as a
frined, situation which probably neither ever imagined. It is very likely that Galas reminded
him of the times he was a small and unsecure child.
