[b]Release 1.0.12 is out![/b] For real; 1.0.11 was labelled 1.0.12 in the forum announcement, although the external tarball and the campaign server distribution were both labelled 1.0.11 from outside and inside the box. Sorry about that.

This is, again, not a release of hot and big changes, except for a major bugfix in one of the latter scenarios. This is the summary of the changes brought to you in this version:

[list][*] Fixed a reference to inexistent scenario id. in the cutscene that takes part after "Welcome to the Lair", which caused the game to end prematurely.(1)
[*] L1 Elvish Hunter has got a full set of animation frames, which they were lacking both for the female and male variations.
[*] Some minor tweaks to Elynia's and Death Baron's animation frames were made; both sets are still uncomplete and far from required quality, though.
[*] Some new foes were added to latter scenarios.
[*] Some WML variables clean-up was added to certain scenarios, reducing saved games' size a bit (i.e. one-three lines); just a convention compliance change.
[*] As per request, mission objectives for scenario 9, "The Library", were clarified.
[*] Hopefully fixed the reported bug in scenario 10, "The Source of Light", related to Mal Keshar's seeking for the glyphs.
[*] Some latter scenarios were balanced and/or minor visual tweaks were made to them. Also, the AI players are now substantially more aggressive.
[*] Added missing ability halo to Master of Darkness.
[*] Balanced Chaos Lore's attack strength.
[*] Optimized some WML chunks.
[*] Updated place-holder portraits and map graphics, amongst others.[/list]

(1): Due to such major bugfix, it is [b]strongly[/b] recommended that you upgrade before reporting bugs.

The bug reporting instructions located in the BUGS.txt file were updated, and a known bug was added. Also, a non-bug was added, but I quote it here nevertheless since I have noted a common misunderstanding of the gameplay of this campaign, which I thought was obvious for anyone who would get past the first enemy boss:

[quote="Shadow Master"]Some scenarios, specially of the last part, contain enemies that may respawn indefinitely if you try (mistakenly) to defeat them. Please, bear in mind that as a general rule for this campaign, [b]you are not supposed to defeat all enemies[/b] unless the objectives summary clearly states so. Attempting to do so may get you stuck in some scenarios.[/quote]

If you download(ed) play this campaign thinking "kill, get gold, kill", then you are horribly mistaken and I'd advice you to go to play another campaign or one of those typical battle arenas/scenarios for MP. I'm also adding part of this information to the formerly-removed warning screen at the start of the campaign.

This campaign was tested and developed with Wesnoth 1.4.

Now, go to play and enjoy!

P.S.: if you wonder why I have not written long and cheesy announcements lately, well, it is because the last ones seemed to be ignored by everybody; therefore I'm no longer wasting time on writing text that no one reads.
