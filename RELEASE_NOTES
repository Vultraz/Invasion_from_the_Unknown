[b]Version 1.9.1 is out![/b]

This one is mainly a polishment release. New sounds, graphics and an additional music track were added, yes; indeed. But that is not the focus of it. While ESR was busy revising the text for the campaign, I got enough spare time to revise many of my own artwork (and a few external ones) and WML. In fact, the most significant revision is the new fifteenth scenario, "Shadows of Time", which came to replace the long-ago-deprecated "Dealing with Orcs". Both the removal and creation of such deprecated scenario left a huge gap in the story line that "Shadows of Time" has come to fix up.

Some terrains and decorations were updated too, but the changes are not very noticeable for the regular player - the real action took place under the hood, optimizing and fixing some terrain-graphics WML. Note however, that the changes invalidate current saved games that have a map_data associated; in other words, it is recommended to reload from the last start-of-scenario ([b]not[/b] first turn) saved game if you see any "unknown terrain" error messages.

Ah well, there [b]is[/b] a big noticeable change. (Hint: thanks mesilliac).

Some minor scenario balancing issues and/or bugs were fixed too.

Special thanks to Syntax_Error for terrain tiles and other stuff. Now go to download and have fun!

[b]Note:[/b] last version released through the campaign server was labeled "1.0.13" in the remote add-ons menu, but it was 1.9.0 actually. This time the new release is labeled 1.9.1.
