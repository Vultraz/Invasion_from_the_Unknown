Invasion from the Unknown - changelog
-------------------------------------

Version 1.10.0-svn:
- Ported from 1.4 branch to trunk. Cycholka ran wmllint on it for
  making it compatible with Wesnoth 1.5.1 and later.

- Language and i18n:
    - Changed unit race text for female Demons from "race+female^Demon"
      to "race+female^Demoness".
    - Changed female unit_type names for the Demon tree to contain be of the
      "Demoness" form rather than "Demon".

- Scenarios:
    - Sanitized many event unit filters.
    - 10 (The Source of Light):
        - Made berserk potion have effect only until the end of this scenario.
        - Fixed some awkward grammar
          (http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=305960#p305960)
    - 16 (Arrival of the Battalion):
        - Fixed a bug which made Quogar Ratham always speak a line that Erathan
          is supposed to speak otherwise.

- Units:
    - Balancing:
        - Gave most units adequate movement costs and defense
          on Reef terrain.
        - Increased Worker Droid's movement costs as follows:
            - Shallow Water: 3 -> 4
            - Swamp Water: 3 -> 4
    - Fixed WEAPON_SPECIAL_DRAINS -> WEAPON_SPECIAL_DRAIN typo on Giant Leech.
    - Removed inclusion of inexistent macro BIRD_NAMES.
    - Removed some engine bug workarounds that we don't need on 1.5.x.

          (or not crash and just wrap around, which would be bad as well)
        + Fixed a design flaw which caused the union event to trigger once
          _for_every_side's_turn_, rather than only for the player's turn
        + Set turn limits
    * 22C (The Backyard):

        + Elyssa/Chaos Warlord has L5 leadership rather than L4 now (this was a
          bug possibly caused by the original unit design supposed to be L4)
