Invasion from the Unknown - changelog

- Ported from 1.4 branch to trunk. Cycholka ran wmllint on it for
  making it compatible with Wesnoth 1.5.1 and later.

- Scenarios:
    - 10 (The Source of Light):
        - Made berserk potion have effect only until the end of this scenario.

- Units:
    - Removed some engine bug workarounds that we don't need on 1.5.x.

        + Set turn limits
    * 22B (The Gauntlet):
        + Added a safety check, copied from scenario 22C, to ensure that
          an internal counter can never get out of range and crash the game
          (or not crash and just wrap around, which would be bad as well)
        + Fixed a design flaw which caused the union event to trigger once
          _for_every_side's_turn_, rather than only for the player's turn
        + Set turn limits
    * 22C (The Backyard):
        + Fixed a design flaw which caused the union event to trigger once
          _for_every_side's_turn_, rather than only for the player's turn
        + Set turn limits
    * 23A (Interim):
        + Balancing
        + Set turn limits
    * 23B (Welcome to the Lair of the Shadow Master)
        + Boss pals are spawned after terrain updates are applied
        + Renamed side 4 leader for continuity
        + Set turn limits
- Terrain:
    * Made custom trees into their own terrain types, as suggested by cycholka
- Units:
    * Balancing:
        + Elyssa/Chaos Warlord has L5 leadership rather than L4 now (this was a
          bug possibly caused by the original unit design supposed to be L4)
